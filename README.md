# purescript-d3-ffi-simplest
Minimal example of D3 general update pattern called from Purescript

All that's going on here is `spago init` and the addition of the `index.html` and `Main.purs` files. That's the minimal part.

OTOH, by deciding to show the General Update Pattern i've introduced the need for async if this is to work properly, so i will add a simpler D3 Chart that takes an array of data from the PureScript side when i come back to add the async in
